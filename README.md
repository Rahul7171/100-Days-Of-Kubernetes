# **Fullstack Web Development Mastery**

Welcome to Fullstack Web Development in Stages! In this repository, you'll find resources and guidance to help you learn the skills you need to become a fullstack web developer, one step at a time.

## **Prerequisites**

Before you get started, it's important to have a basic understanding of the following technologies:

* HTML: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It consists of a series of elements, or tags, that specify the content and layout of a web page.
    
* CSS: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. With CSS, you can control the font, color, size, and spacing of elements on a web page.
    
* JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used in web development. It allows you to add interactive features to your web pages, such as form validation and creating animations.
    

If you're new to these technologies, don't worry! There are plenty of resources available online to help you get up to speed. Some good places to start include:

* [**HTML and CSS Tutorials**](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp)
